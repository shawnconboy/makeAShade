            <h2>Questions & Answers</h2>

            <p>
                Have you been seeing lots of cars driving around with their windows tinted? Are you thinking about
                getting your car windows tinted because of that?
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                There's just something about a car with tinted windows, isn't there? It gives it instant panache and
                raises its coolness factor.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Either way, if you are not sure of what kind of questions to ask your tinting company, then we've got
                you
                covered below.
            </p>


            <h3>
                1. How Long Will It Take?
            </h3>

            <p>
                If it's your first time getting your car windows tinted, you are probably wondering about timelines.
                Depending on how many windows are getting tinted, it usually takes from 45 minutes to a couple of hours.
                If
                you want to wait while it's done, you can.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Most people are fascinated by the process, so they stick around to watch the specialist tinting their
                car
                windows.
            </p>


            <h3>
                2. How Long Will It Last?
            </h3>

            <p>
                This is a big question to ask your window tinting company. As with everything else, the longevity of the
                window tinting will depend upon the quality and product type of the window tints. It will also depend on
                the
                climate, and the amount of sun the tinted windows get exposed to.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Most high-quality automotive films will last 5-10 years, depending on the film used. In fact, it usually
                ends up lasting longer than the owner keeps the vehicle.
            </p>

            <h3>
                3. Do You Offer a Warranty?
            </h3>

            <p>
                If you want to ensure that any window tinting issues are covered for a few months, years, or even a
                decade,
                then this is a good question to include in your list. Every car window tinting company is different in
                the
                kind of warranty it offers, so it's better to know in advance what you are getting yourself into.
            </p>

            <h3>
                4. Is Window Tinting Legal?
            </h3>

            <p>
                Any window behind the vehicle's b-pillar can be tinted. But the front windshield cannot, because of
                limits
                of visible light transmission.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Only a clear safety film and a UV shield can be applied to the windshield. Of course, each state might
                be
                different in the way it regulates this, so make sure you talk to your window tinting company to clarify
                the
                laws.
            </p>

            <h3>
                5. Does the Rear Window Tinting Affect the Defroster?
            </h3>

            <p>
                You are probably wondering about this since you don't want to be stranded on a cold or rainy day with
                your rear defroster being out of action. In fact, tinting the rear windows doesn't affect the defroster
                negatively and might even hasten up the process of defrosting by dispersing the heat more quickly and
                evenly.
            </p>

            <h3>
                6. Will It Affect My GPS?
            </h3>

            <p>
                Having your windows tinted will not affect your GPS or any electromagnetic transmissions. Same with
                audio
                equipment antennas - they are unaffected by the windows getting tinted. You can keep enjoying those
                tunes on
                your radio and finding your way to faraway places with your GPS.
            </p>

            <h3>
                7. How Long before I Can Open My Windows?
            </h3>

            <p>
                You might be eager to roll down the windows and let the sun and breeze flow through. But it's important
                to
                let the window film, which is applied wet, dry off completely before using the windows. Depending on the
                climate, it can take all the way from 24 to 48 hours.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                If you do roll down the windows when the film is still wet, it can result in peeling. Take extra
                precautions
                during this time to avoid ruining your tinted windows.
            </p>

            <h3>
                8. How Do I Clean My Tinted Windows?
            </h3>

            <p>
                The surface of the film used to tint windows is fairly hard-wearing and prevents scratching and protects
                the
                deeper layers of film. That's why all you need to do to clean it is use a mild glass cleaner and a soft
                cloth.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Avoid using squeegees or scrapers on your newly tinted windows. This will keep the tint going for longer
                and
                give you a great return on investment (ROI).
            </p>


            <h3>
                9. If I Have to Sell My Vehicle, Can the Tint Be Removed?
            </h3>

            <p>
                It's easy to remove the film from the windows, without damaging the glass. If you have anything printed
                on
                the glass, like demister, antennas, and/or alarm wiring, then you will need to exercise extra caution.
                Whenever you are unsure about the process of removing the tint, you are more than welcome to go back to
                your
                window tinting company and get their help.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                They do this all day long and are experts at both removing and putting on the tints.
            </p>


            <h3>
                10. Can Window Tinting Be Done at My Work or Home?
            </h3>


            <p>
                You might have seen certain window tinting companies advertising that they will come to your home or
                place
                of work to do the window tinting. But it's highly unadvisable to do this.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Window tinting requires a clean, enclosed space to do the work properly. The enclosed space needs to be
                big
                enough to allow the car doors to open and have a power supply.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                If you do window tinting outdoors, there is a possibility that the breeze can blow contaminants and
                debris
                onto the surfaces to be tinted and end up in between the glass and the film.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Think you have a suitable space to do the work? Then the tinting company would be more than happy to
                come to
                you.
